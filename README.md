# Smart Arduino Sound System for Sony hcd-h150 / h500
Sound system update thanks to Arduino

Software for Arduino UNO that allows you to turn on and change the inputs of the Sony hcd-h150 / h500 sound equipment.

As soon as the system detects sound in any of the audio equipment inputs, the arduino triggers the starter and switches to the appropriate input.
